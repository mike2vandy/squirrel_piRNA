## calcDivergenceFromAlignModified.pl  

This script is a modification of a Perl script that comes with RepeatMasker. It will read a .align file and produce a tab delimited TE annotation file with Kimura 2-parameter distances.  

This is was modified from an older version of calcDivervgence and RepeatMasker has since updated. However, this script will work on modern .align output files if placed in a RepeatMasker/utils directory.
